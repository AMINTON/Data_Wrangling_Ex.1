# Data_Wrangling_Ex.1
Basic data manipulation exercise.
This assignment aims to develop elementary data wrangling skills using R and R packages with emphasis on dplyr and tidyr. 
Refine_original.csv is a small, toy data set showing product purchases from an electronics store. 
Basic instructions on steps for data wrangling were given separately and are outlined in Data Wrangling Ex.1 Code.rmd. 
Data Wrangling Ex.1 Code.rmd also includes code used to build the final data table in refine_clean.csv.
